## How to make veggie pizza recipe

For ease of understanding, I have divided the post into 3 main parts:

1. **Making the pizza bread**
2. **Making the pizza sauce**
3. **Assembling pizza**

**Lets start with step 1 â€“ making the pizza base**

1: dissolve the sugar in warm water and add dry active yeast to it.

2: stir the whole mixture and keep it aside for 10 to 15 minutes.

3: when the yeast is getting doubled up, take a cup of flour with salt in a bowl. Mix well. Add olive oil.

4: after 10 to 15 minutes the yeast will bubble and you will see a good frothy layer on top.

5: now add the frothy yeast mixture to the flour. With a whisk or wooden spoon stir the mixture.

6: add another cup of flour and keep on stirring.

7: the mixture will become sticky.

8: add the last cup of flour and continue to stir.

9: the dough will leave the sides of the bowl but still will be a bit sticky.

10: it is time now to knead the dough with the hand. knead the dough to a smooth dough. Dust with flour to prevent sticking. The dough will be soft and elastic. Apply some olive oil to the dough all around.

11: keep the dough in a deep large bowl and cover loosely with a kitchen napkin or towel for 1.5 to 2 hours.
